# MovieRecommender
## Notes
- Preprend "tt0" to IMDB ID ; for example: https://imdb-api.com/en/API/Images/k_oe50pt39/tt0102744/Short
- 3 Main Datasets: Links.csv, Movies.csv, Ratings.csv from grouplens.org. We will use only Links and Ratings.csv for backend.

## To-do
- Test adjusted weight sum
- Build test case automation to generate various user profiles
- Build UI and connect IMDB API
- Stress-test against larger dataset (25 Million), since speed is currently excellent
